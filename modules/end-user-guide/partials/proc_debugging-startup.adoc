= Debugging DevWorkspace startup

[role="_abstract"]
If you want to learn more about why a workspace has entered a "failed" state when starting, you can add the following annotation to your devworkspace:
	
.Annotations for debugging devworkspace startup
[cols="40,10,10,~"]
|===
|Annotation |Default| Required| Descriptionc

|controller.devfile.io/debug-start
|None
|no
|If you want to debug the startup of the DevWorkspace. If not specified or false, the DevWorkspace will not start in debug mode
|===

When the "controller.devfile.io/debug-start" annotation is set to true and the devworkspace enters a failed state, the devworkspace deployment will not scale down, allowing you to view logs and diagnose what happened.

.Procedure

* Add the `'controller.devfile.io/debug-start': 'true` annotation to a DevWorkspace that is failing to start
